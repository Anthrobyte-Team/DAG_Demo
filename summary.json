Prepared on September 16, 2025, it emphasizes transitioning from reactive logistics to proactive, data-driven decision-making. The KPIs are categorized into four groups:\n\n1. **Core Logistical KPIs**: Measure efficiency in time, cost, and material integrity (e.g., On-Time Flag, Delay Minutes, Rs/t-km, Shrinkage %).\n2. **Diagnostic & Contextual KPIs**: Identify reasons for performance deviations (e.g., Weather-Attributed Delay, Grade Mix Entropy).\n3. **Predictive & Strategic KPIs**: Evaluate long-term partner and pathway performance (e.g., Supplier Reliability, Route Risk Score).\n4. **Integrated Insights**: Combine KPIs for a holistic \"Control Tower\" view.\n\nThe framework aims to reduce costs, improve operational predictability, mitigate risks, and enhance partner performance. It includes an implementation roadmap with phases for data foundation, KPI implementation, and integration into business processes. The goal is to foster continuous improvement and data-driven excellence in NTPC's coal logistics network.",

  "rag_uploads/d23dd3607426b3f69b7cf5f5fb67c106NTPC_Operations_Knowledge_Document_1.pdf": "The NTPC Operations Knowledge Document outlines essential guidelines and best practices for managing the coal supply chain to ensure reliable and cost-effective operations at NTPC power plants. Key definitions include:\n\n- **Underperformance**: When suppliers or logistics routes fail to meet agreed KPIs, such as delivering less than 90% on-time or supplying only 85% of scheduled coal.\n- **Risk Score**: A 0-10 scale assessing the risk of supply disruption based on factors like route length, transport mode, weather, infrastructure, and historical reliability. Scores of 8-10 indicate high-risk routes.\n- **Route Optimization**: Selecting efficient and reliable transport paths to minimize costs and transit time while managing risks.\n- **Lead Time**: The transit time from mine to plant, crucial for evaluating route performance.\n- **Landed Coal Cost**: Total cost of coal delivered to the plant, including logistics, with strategies to reduce it focusing on route optimization and operational efficiency.\n- **Loading Efficiency**: Measures the effectiveness of loading/unloading operations, with lower efficiency indicating delays.\n\nOperational guidelines emphasize maintaining adequate coal stock (15-17 days for pithead plants, 20-30 days for non-pithead), conducting regular supplier performance reviews, and using data-driven decisions to optimize logistics and reduce costs.",
